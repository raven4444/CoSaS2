Task 1; There is a utility room which holds the main power switches for the building.  I must determine which switch cuts off power to the elevator, and then ensure that it stays off.

Task 2;  I will need to find my way into the building's main security control room.  Once inside, I will need to crack the pass code which will shut off the cameras both in the security room, and in the vault.

Once I choose my task, another agent will perform the other; I won't be able to change my mind."
