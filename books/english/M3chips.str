Yes, it's alright for Raputo's men to play with real money... in fact, you shouldn't have given them that 200 gold in chips in the first place.  If they should win anything (fat chance!) or want to return their chips, they can come back tomorrow to get the difference.  You can leave as soon as the gong rings the shift change, since the head accountant wants the ledgers finished early tonight.  Besides, you've got a long day ahead of you tomorrow if the Ivory Rose does get sold."
