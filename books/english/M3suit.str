I would simply go get it myself but every time I leave my room your accursed guardspeople give me trouble! Who goes there?  Where are you going? Why aren't you downstairs gambling and getting drunk?  The nerve!

I demand that you send a servant up at once to deliver my suit to my door immediately! - Lord Shoemaker"
