Grichemer, don't forget that as the foreman here you are in a privileged position!  You get your own room, your own office, and a higher salary than most.  So, I expect you to keep a tight rein on the activities of the casino staff.  I expect a nightly report to be delivered to the accountants' desk, detailing all expenditures during the course of casino operation, no matter how trivial.  If anything goes missing from the changing room again, or if my staff finds any discrepancy between their ledgers and our actual funds, it's coming from YOUR pay.
