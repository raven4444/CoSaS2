Laddy,
I'm tellin ye, it's not the wiring, the wiring's good.  It's the fixtures.  They're what's giving you the trouble.  I sit there and dump water on the wires all day and they're fine but - two splashes at one of the lamps themselves and they fizzel out in a shower of sparks!  You need to replace the lamps, not the wires!
