Pikyun, these are the expenses racked up by Delled, Clarence, and Petunia in their little private party in the clubhouse.  Take it out of their wages.  I don't care if she says they bullied her into opening the casks - bill her too.

Taffin Times Ale - 3 bottles, 1 sp each; Pagan Promise Mead - 1 bottle, 10 sp; Venus Vineyard's Special - 1 bottle, 20 gp; 1 broken goblet  15 gp

Also, the bill for the piano tuner was 30 gp, and the harp tuner was 40 gp.  Another 20 gp for repairs to Stormcloud's bow, which they somehow managed to taff up using it to shoot empty bottles of the ale off the balcony.
