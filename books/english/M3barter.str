I already took the money down, but the vault's off-limits until the big meeting is done, so it's all stored in the guard post until later.  I'm going to head upstairs and make my entries in the general ledger for this extra barter we received late... we got quite a bit more spice, so I'll have to write a special note for the head accountant.  I wish they wouldn't keep those ledgers separate, but what are you gonna do?
