I cannot live with that marmoset of a shrew any longer!  Let us elope.  Soon I will have sold the Ivory Rose, and we can retire to the countryside to live in luxury... but it must be done in secret!  Late tomorrow, my trusted servant will escort you to the entrance of the First City Bank and Trust.  After I cash the bonds I will join you, and we will meet Father Bluber, who will marry us. I have it on good authority that he takes bribes, and will not register us.  Then we will travel to Sweegy Woods, by the shores of Poeskas Lake, where rapture will be ours until we die.

~ Your Love"
