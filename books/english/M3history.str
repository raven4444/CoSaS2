Page_0: "A Brief History of the Ivory Rose Casino and Hotel

The Ivory Rose Casino was built approximately sixty years ago when 'Stormcloud', an infamous bandit, spent his massive fortune on a luxury resort/casino, catering to the upper classes.  Notorious for its crooked wheels and deceitful dealers, the Ivory Rose soon fell out of favor, and nearly went bankrupt.  However, Cloud II ended his father's cheating practices and brought the Ivory Rose back into repute as an honest gambling establishment, though in the process he found it necessary to open the casino to the middle classes.  About twenty years ago the building was expanded to the north, adding a four-story luxury hotel to the grand casino section.  Since then the profits have been rolling in.  The current owner, Cloud III, is famous for his exquisite taste and unmatchable business skills.  Under his leadership the Ivory Rose is predicted to meet even higher levels of financial success!"
