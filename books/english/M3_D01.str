The Eye discriminates between friend and foe based on color; typically gold and blue are seen as friends, while black, brown and red activate the Eyes. Eyes must be programmed.

Warning: extending the Eye beyond its arc of movement will cause damage.  Do not tilt.  

Keep away from heat, cold, moisture, dust, and bright lights. Repetitive movements will not be registered as threats. Connection to turret optional."
