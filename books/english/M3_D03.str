Cloud's gone batty and clearly interested in getting out of the business, and I don't want this place falling into the hands of the highest bidder.  Howe is already with me on this one.  The three of us need to 'talk to' Roenel and see what the cripes Cloud is planning.  Maybe we won't have to 'get rid of him' but if we must we will.  Then we 'buy' this place ourselves and run it like it should be run.  Think three-way partnership.  I mean, who better to own the place than the sods who run it.  Not a W0RD of this to Grechemer or especially Ruckenaw.  That greedy bastard will stab us in the back the first chance he gets. - Cyrano"
