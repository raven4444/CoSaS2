Page_0: "Grichemer -  I know that Cyrano wants one of us to make sure that the clubhouse always gets locked up for the night, especially the balcony doors.  But damnit Grichemer, the guards in the clubhouse have locked themselves in again, refuse to answer to my knocks, and most definitely have left the balcony doors wide open.  It will, of course, be my ass tomorrow when Cyrano checks and finds them like that.  How am I supposed to lock them when I don't have a key to the place and the guards won't let me in?  Am I supposed to climb up the balcony from the outside like the thieves we're trying to keep out?
