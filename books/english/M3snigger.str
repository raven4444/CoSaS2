Something happened at brunch today that shocked and appalled me.  I was sitting with my business partners, discussing our latest transactions, when suddenly I heard someone sniggering!  I got up to look around, but the only other thing I heard was a fading, rustling noise, coming from a nearby grille... but when I approached there was nothing to be seen.  You must understand that my business requires the utmost privacy, and I will resort to lawsuits to protect my interests.  I trust you to take action about this!
