Page_0: "Task 1; There is a utility room in the casino’s basement which holds the main power switches for the building.  I must determine which switch cuts off power to the elevator, and then ensure that it stays off.  Once that is done, Agent Stone, who is on the roof, will be able to enter the building through the elevator’s shaft, and enter the casino’s vault.  Problems I will face include flipping the wrong switch, thus alerting the guards that someone is taffing about, and making sure that a staff person does not turn the power back on after I have left the area, putting Stone’s life in grave danger."
Page_1: "Task 2;  I will need to climb through the casino’s maze of ventilation shafts and find my way into the building’s main security control room.  Once inside, I will need to crack the pass code which will shut off the cameras both in the security room, and in the vault.  This will allow Agent Stone to enter the vault without having to worry about the unblinking eyes of the security cameras tripping any alarms.  Problems I will face include the fact that a similar unblinking eye is present in the security room.  I guess my pain is Agent Stone's gain."
