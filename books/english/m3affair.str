Darling,
I've arranged for you-know-who to take over the rest of my shift, and you-don't-know-who to change the work schedule to give you a certain three hour 'dinner break' for you-know-what.  I'll meet you in the public bath on the second floor tomorrow night at you-know-when, and then we'll sneak into one of the nearby rooms that I made sure wouldn't be book'd.  Please, dear, not a word of this to anyone.  If Cyrano or someone even worse finds out, I know I'll never see you again."
